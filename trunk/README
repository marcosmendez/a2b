a2b is an abstract train game where you guide trains to their destination
without letting them collide with each other. Each game is played on a 
set of tracks on which trains run at regular intervals.  You click-pick 
a train and accelerate, brake or stop as necessary to safely guide it to 
its destination. Since trains are continously being launched, more than 1 
train  will want to use the same section of a track potentially leading to a 
collision. You resolve this by making a train wait while you rush another 
train or in a hopeless situation even send a train back to its base. When 
you despatch 100 trains, a level is complete.  2 more tracks are added to 
the network and the game continues.

Controls:

* Press DOWN arrow key to brake (and reverse) the selected train.
